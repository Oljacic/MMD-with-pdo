# MMD-with-pdo 

MMD stand for Manipulation-MySql-Data.
This is example from PHP & MYSQL novice to ninja by Kevin Yank, with little adjustment.
I recommend this book to read, there are some people that are calling this book "The Bible of Database driven website".
Example is used just in learning purposes.

## Getting Started

This tasks only needs an updated browser, some web server solution stack and a code editor to add, change or delete few stuff.

* Clone the repo..
* Import database file...
* Do what ever you like...
